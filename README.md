# Google PlayStore
The Google Play Store Analysis Model in Jupyter Notebook is a data-driven project that explores and analyzes mobile app trends, user ratings, and other key factors to gain insights into app performance. This project uses Python in Jupyter Notebook to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning-based predictions. The dataset contains information about apps, including category, rating, number of installs, reviews, size, price, and content rating. The analysis involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, visualizing trends, and identifying patterns that impact app success. Key insights include factors influencing high ratings, pricing strategies, popularity trends, and category-based performance. Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest may be used to predict app ratings based on historical data. Performance metrics like accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) help evaluate model effectiveness. This project is beneficial for developers, marketers, and data analysts looking to understand app market trends and optimize strategies for app success on the Google Play Store.
