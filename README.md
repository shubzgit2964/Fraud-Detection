# Fraud-Detection
The Fraud Detection Model in Jupyter Notebook is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing historical data and detecting anomalies. This project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, making it interactive and easy to follow. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. The dataset is carefully processed to handle missing values, outliers, and class imbalances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to improve detection accuracy. The model is trained to recognize suspicious transactions based on key attributes such as transaction amount, location, time, and user behavior. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness. The goal is to develop a robust fraud detection system that can flag fraudulent activities with high accuracy while minimizing false positives. This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide, making it a valuable resource for data scientists, financial analysts, and cybersecurity professionals looking to implement fraud detection using machine learning.
